# Group SSH with shell

A program to that opens K terminals and makes K SSH connections.

# Example

### Compile

`make`

### Run 

`./shell <ssh name> <ip1> <ip2> ...`

# TODO 

1. Allow Reading inputs from file 

2. Allow automatic usage based on the OS type (not only gnome-open) ([MAC example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9569967/how-do-you-launch-terminal-mac-using-c-code))

3. Support split screen instead of multiple screen in places like `terminator` terminal. 

4. Add binaries for different targets.
